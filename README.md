PicturePuzzle
=============

Android puzzle game inspired by the classic 15-puzzle game that breaks up a picture into blocks and lets the user swap two blocks at a time to unscramble the picture. But unlike the classic game which swaps two adjacent blocks, this game lets swap any two blocks at a time.
